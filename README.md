# Portfolio Website

Hello and welcome!

You've landed on my Portfolio Website, a digital showcase of my projects and blog posts, all centered around the dynamic world of cyber security. While my academic journey in computer science has allowed me to explore a broad spectrum of technologies, this site reflects my passion for delving into new areas and expanding my technical horizons.

The website is hosted [here](https://www.parmingo.com).

## Technology Used

I have listed the technical skills and programs used when creating this website:

- **HTML / CSS**: the foundational building blocks for layout and applying styles.
- **Bootstrap**: utilized for responsiveness of the website.
- **JavaScript**: utilized for features such as the type writer and the truncation of blog posts.
- **Node.js**: utilized for server-side scripting to allow the website to handle requests, interact with the database, and deliver content dynamically.
- **MySQL**: utilized to create a relational database management system to store, retrieve and manage data efficiently.
- **PlanetScale**: an online website that allowed me to host the MySQL database for the database connection using Node.js.
- **GitHub**: utilized for version control.
- **Render**: deployed as the hosting platform for the website as it offered automated deployments directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Google Domains**: used for the custom domain as it provides reliable DNS management and domain privacy features.

## Future Plans

These are the future planned updates I have for the website:

- Utilizing **Jekyll** for blog posts so PDF does not have to be attached everytime for a new blog post **OR** utilizing Node.js again to create an HTML page everytime for a new blog post. This may not be the best method, therefore, I will look into Angular and see what I can do.
- **Login system** which will allow me to login and create posts directly from the website.
